# nwg-shell-wallpapers
This repository contains a selection of wallpapers contributed to the nwg-shell project. Due to the fact, that the project logo has been changed, for the 1.0 release we only have some great works by [badkarma](https://forum.archlabslinux.com/u/badkarma/summary) (many thanks!), and several poor renders by myself.

First verion of the nwg-shell logo was designed by [SGS](https://github.com/sgse). The author of the current version is [edskeye](https://github.com/edskeye).
