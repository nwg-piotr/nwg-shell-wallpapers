# nwg-shell-wallpapers
This repository contains a selection of wallpapers contributed to the nwg-shell project. Due to the fact, that the [project logo](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell-resources/blob/master/resources/logo.svg) has been changed, for the 1.0 release we only have some great works by [badkarma](https://forum.archlabslinux.com/u/badkarma/summary) (many thanks!), and several poor renders by myself.
